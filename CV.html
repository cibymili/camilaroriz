            Is currently part of the Cyberpunk and Capitalist Realism Study Group. The CCRSG is a multi-disciplinary group of academics, students, activists, artists and musicians instigated by Carmen Schmöl at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Their goal is to examine the cultural significance of cyberpunk by paying special attention to the entanglement of space and identities in the sphere of postmodernism and capitalist realism

            Camila is a Brazilian multimedia artist working in both physical and digital realms. One of her main interests is exploring how technology can be a visual translator of physical experiments. Inspired by scholars and sci-fi writers such as Donna Haraway and Octavia Butler, her practice oscillates from painting to 3D and VR scenarios where she creates different characters and new worlds.
